                <p style={styles.mernDescription}><b>MERN</b> Stack is a Javascript Stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full-stack web applications. MERN Stack comprises of namely 4 technologies: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. It is designed to make the development process smoother and easier.</p>

                <p style={styles.mernDescription}>Each of these 4 powerful technologies provides an end-to-end framework for the developers to work in and each of these technologies plays a big part in the development of web applications.</p>

                <h3 style={styles.codeTitle}>MongoDB:</h3>
                <p style={styles.codePara}>"MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era."</p>

                <p style={styles.codePara}>What I like about MongoDB is that it is not a relational database. Typical SQL databases organize their data into tables and rows. I feel this can be constricting when you are trying to create a database to serve your exact needs. MongoDB, instead, organizes its data into JSON documents, making querying the data much more dynamic.</p>



                <h3 style={styles.codeTitle}>Express:</h3>
                <p style={styles.codePara}>"Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications."</p>

                <p style={styles.codePara}>Express.js makes routing quite simple. When making GET, POST, or any other kind of XML request, Express allows for responding to client requests a breeze. In addition, Express allows me to easily use Middleware, a function carried out before data is returned to the client, to ensure whatever XML request being made is carried out with extreme precision.</p>



                <h3 style={styles.codeTitle}>React:</h3>
                <p style={styles.codePara}>"React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications."</p>

                <p style={styles.codePara}>React is all about putting the user experience first. By loading and switching out components, rather than making an entirely new request to a server to display content, React provides a cleaner, seamless, and overall more pleasant user experience.</p>



                <h3 style={styles.codeTitle}>Node.js:</h3>
                <p style={styles.codePara}>"Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser."</p>

                <p style={styles.codePara}>Node allows me to work with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) apps in a much more manageable way.</p>
